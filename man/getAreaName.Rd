\title{Determines which administrative areas contain the given points}
\usage{
getAreaName(
  pts,
  shapefile,
  areaNameVar = "NAME_1",
  delta = 0.05,
  mean.neighbor = 50
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pts}{2 column matrix of lon/lat coordinates}

\item{shapefile}{A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object}

\item{areaNameVar}{The column name in \code{slot(shapefile, "data")} corresponding to the area level of interest}

\item{delta}{Argument passed to fields.rdist.near in fields package}

\item{mean.neighbor}{Argument passed to fields.rdist.near in fields package}
}
\value{
A list of area IDs, area names, whether or not 
points are in multiple areas, and whether or not points 
are in no areas and assigned to the nearest one.
}
\description{
For any points not in an area, they are assigned the nearest area using 
fields.rdist.near with a warning.
}
\details{
delta and mean.neighbor arguments only used when some points 
are not in areas, perhaps due to inconsistencies in shapefiles.
