\title{Obtain the Horvitz-Thompson direct estimates and standard errors using delta method for multiple surveys.}
\usage{
getDirectList(
  births,
  years,
  regionVar = "region",
  timeVar = "time",
  clusterVar = "~v001+v002",
  ageVar = "age",
  weightsVar = "v005",
  Ntrials = NULL,
  geo.recode = NULL,
  national.only = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{births}{A list of child-month data from multiple surveys from \code{\link{getBirths}}. The name of the list is used as the identifier in the output.}

\item{years}{String vector of the year intervals used}

\item{regionVar}{Variable name for region, typically 'v024', for older surveys might be 'v101'}

\item{timeVar}{Variable name for the time period indicator in the input births data.}

\item{clusterVar}{Variable name for the IDs in the second-stage cluster sampling, typically '~v001 + v002', i.e., the cluster number and household number. When no cluster sampling design exists, this variable usually is the household ID.}

\item{ageVar}{Variable name for age group. This variable need to be in the form of "a-b" where a and b are both ages in months. For example, "1-11" means age between 1 and 11 months, including both end points. An exception is age less than one month can be represented by "0" or "0-0".}

\item{weightsVar}{Variable name for sampling weights, typically 'v005'}

\item{Ntrials}{Variable for the total number of person-months if the input data (births) is in the compact form.}

\item{geo.recode}{The recode matrix to be used if region name is not consistent across different surveys. See \code{changeRegion}.}

\item{national.only}{Logical indicator to obtain only the national estimates}
}
\value{
This is the extension to the \code{\link{getDirect}} function that returns estimates from multiple surveys. Additional columns in the output (survey and surveyYears) specify the estimates from different surveys.
