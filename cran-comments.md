## Version 2.0.0 Update
* Major updates to the functionalities. See the News file for details.
* The doc directory contains static vignettes that provide more details in using the package.

Since the package also concerns visualizing space-time smoothing models for fine geographic areas, the resulting vignettes are slightly larger in size as well. The current file sizes are comparable to previous versions. We see NOTEs
     sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
       data   2.0Mb
       doc    3.1Mb
