Description: Provides methods for spatial and spatio-temporal smoothing of demographic and health indicators using survey data, with particular focus on estimating and projecting under-five mortality rates, described in Mercer et al. (2015) <doi:10.1214/15-AOAS872>
  and Li et al. (2019) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0210645>.
