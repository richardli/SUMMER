#' Determines which administrative areas contain the given points
#' 
#' For any points not in an area, they are assigned the nearest area using 
#' fields.rdist.near with a warning.
#' 
#' @param pts 2 column matrix of lon/lat coordinates
#' @param shapefile A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object
#' @param areaNameVar The column name in \code{slot(shapefile, "data")} corresponding to the area level of interest
#' @param delta Argument passed to fields.rdist.near in fields package
#' @param mean.neighbor Argument passed to fields.rdist.near in fields package
#' 
#' @details delta and mean.neighbor arguments only used when some points 
#' are not in areas, perhaps due to inconsistencies in shapefiles.
